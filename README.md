Ethereum-Compatible Financial Institutions – STAGE ONE

SCREENSHOT (766)

While in Remix, I will be starting a new file to code Solidity. The first screenshot has payable addresses to three (3) different employees I plan on paying. I have also included a Constructor, Balance, and Deposit function. I have now compiled my smart contract and will show how to deploy on the next screenshot.

On this screenshot, I have an account entered for which I will be paying from and the three (3) accounts I will be paying an equal amount to. The address starting with “Ox5B3” and holding an amount of 99.9 ether is the main paying account. At this point, I transact (Orange button) and will see a green check at the bottom for conformation. Also, I will now be able to view my smart contract and interact with it. At this point, my contract is live and working.

The final screenshot is the “deposit and balance” section. This is how I will deposit and check balances for a certain account. The FIRST stage of setting up an Ethereum-compatible blockchain for financial institutions is now complete.
